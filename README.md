### Hi, I'm Asia 👋 
---

I’m a ✨ _recent_ ✨ Data Science bootcamp graduate and DS teaching assistant with a [background in the creative tech industry](https://www.popappshop.io/), experience in management and operations, looking to deepen my knowledge of machine learning through implementing fun (and sometimes useful) projects. I am an autodidact that enjoys applying creative solutions to data-driven environments, making the leap from no-code to mo' code. I enjoy using 🐍 Python and SQL, and love visualizing  👁️👄👁️ it with Heroku, Streamlit, HTML, and CSS.
