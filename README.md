### Hi there 👋 

I’m a ✨ _recent_ ✨ Data Science bootcamp graduate with a background in the creative tech industry, experience in management and operations, looking to deepen my knowledge of machine learning through implementing fun (and sometimes useful) projects. I am an autodidact that enjoys applying creative solutions to data-driven environments, making the leap from no-code to mo' code. I enjoy using 🐍 Python and SQL, and love visualizing  👁️👄👁️ it with Heroku, Streamlit, HTML, and CSS.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app that predicts my perfect week based on data collected over five years
- 🌱 I recently released an app that predicts the 2024 UK Elections here, see our collaboration here
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on weird, fun, or semi-useful projects
- 💬 Ask me about Baldur’s Gate 3

- 📫 How to reach me: nnoble.data@gmail.com _that’s two n’s!_
